# Product Design Recruiting Process Overview

At BuzzFeed, Product Design Managers are responsible for hiring designers and growing the Product Design team. While Design Managers work closely with and are supported by our partners in Recruiting, it is ultimately up to us to source, sell, vet, and close potential design candidates.

Documented here is our ever-evolving process, which I've broken down into five distinct chunks: **Getting Started, Sourcing, Screening, On-Site Interviews, and Offers & Onboarding**.

## Getting Started

The first thing we need to do is create an open rec for the specific role(s) in Greenhouse. You can do this yourself or ask a Recruiter for help. Please use the following syntax for labeling recs:

[Position Level], [Group / Team Name]

Examples:

Senior Product Designer, Video Tools  
Associate Product Designer, Apps

When publishing the new job rec in Greenhouse, make sure you opt out of publishing a public job post in conjunction with the rec.

**Why don't we post Product Design listings on BuzzFeed.com/jobs?**
Historically we have received a higher percentage of unqualified, non-design candidates through /jobs compared to other platforms. This is largely because Product Design is still a niche field and the BuzzFeed.com audience is broad. Managing these applications takes time away from more productive methods of sourcing.

## Sourcing Candidates

We find prospective candidates through both incoming, and outgoing efforts.

**Incoming**  
Instead of posting on BuzzFeed.com/jobs we have a Google Form application which can be found on Medium https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/join-the-buzzfeed-product-design-team-433f9a5dc560, a platform which attracts a larger share of product designers in its audience.

Prospects who apply through the Google Form will appear in the "Incoming" tab of our Product Design Candidates spreadsheet. Design Managers are expected to frequently go through the tab and sort out qualified prospects into the "Candidates" tab and unqualified prospects into the "Nope" tab. A qualified prospect is anyone who could be a potential fit for a future open role, even roles we aren't currently hiring for. For example, even if we are not currently hiring Associate Product Designers for any open roles, if there are entry-level prospects who seem promising we still want to add them to our list for the future. An unqualified prospect is someone who, regardless of experience, doesn't possess product design skills. Often these tend to be designers in adjacent roles who do not identify as Product Designers but rather graphic designers, product managers, visual designers, etc...

**Outgoing**  
Our second source of candidates is reliant on pulling from both within our own networks and beyond— searching on sites such as LinkedIn, Dribbble, Twitter, and Medium for like-minded individuals doing interesting work. As design managers we should always have our eye out for prospective candidates, even when we aren't hiring. When we find a prospective candidate through one of these means, we can manually add them to the spreadsheet directly into the "Candidates" tab. When adding a candidate, we should do our best to fill in as much available information on them: portfolio, contact information, and current position. It's a good idea to double check on LinkedIn to see how long they've been at their current job. For candidates who started a job in the last six months, it is better to add them to the "Check Back" in a spreadsheet with a projected date (typically after they've been in their position at least nine months) on when to reach out.

**The Check Back Tab**  
The "Check Back" tab has two sections— one for checking back according to time: they recently started a new role, aren't ready to move, or aren't interested at this point in time. And a section for checking back according to role— they aren't a good fit for current openings but we should reach back out to them if we end up hiring for a role that is a better fit. This could mean fit in terms of seniority, but could also include subject-matter fit. For example, focusing on tools vs consumer products.

**Reaching Out**  
Now that we have a list of viable candidates in our 'Candidates' tab, it's up to Design Managers and Senior Product Designers to go down the list and reach out to candidates via Email. Before reaching out, we should double check that the candidate's portfolio work, experience, and what we know of their current situation lines up with what we're looking for. If not, we should move them to the appropriate tab (Check Back vs Nope).

When reaching out via Email the key points to communicate to candidates are:

  * Identify yourself and your role at BuzzFeed: establish that the message is coming from another designer.  
  * Why you think they might be a good fit: reference something specific: their work, their process, etc... Keep it succinct.
  * What role we are trying to fill: design for internal tools, apps, etc...
  * Ask if they'd be interested in learning more. We don't want to coldly ask people to interview, but rather ask them for an opportunity for us to sell the role and an opportunity for
