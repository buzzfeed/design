# Tech Leadership Principles
*At BuzzFeed, we believe that every member of the Tech team, regardless of their level or role, can and should strive to become a leader. Laid out below are a series of principles - core beliefs that we value and attempt to live up to with every interaction we have and each artifact we create - that help us evaluate our decision-making and nudge us in the right direction when we lack clarity.*

## Raises the Bar
Leaders at BuzzFeed consistently strive for greatness, both in themselves and in their teams. Their high standards are reflected in their work (leaving projects better than they found them) and interactions with others, as well as the direct feedback they give to their teammates. Leaders at BuzzFeed embrace the idea of Radical Candor and are active in challenging and developing the people they work alongside.

## Takes Responsibility
You’ll never hear, “That’s not my job,” or “That’s someone else’s fault,” from a leader at BuzzFeed. They are quick to jump in and help people, and frequently engage with other teams and parts of the product. When a leader sees an opportunity to solve problems - whether in the product, on their team or in the culture - they dive in headfirst and get the right people involved. And when things go wrong, leaders take responsibility and ownership rather than pass the blame onto others.

## Ships Great Products
BuzzFeed values quality and reliability in the products we ship. As a result, leaders contribute to the overall vision and direction of the products and projects they work on. They defend their projects’ quality, choosing to reduce the scope of a project rather than compromise the user experience or introduce technical debt.

## Hires Well
With each hire, leaders look to raise the bar for our organization. We never hire someone simply to fill a position, instead choosing to tough it out until we find a stellar candidate. Our leaders are also highly engaged with their discipline’s community outside of BuzzFeed, identifying and recruiting talented individuals in their field that might be great fits at BuzzFeed.

## Invests Strategically
Leaders are always aware of how they and their teams spend their time and attention. They are constantly asking themselves if we’re investing our people and efforts in the right places, as well as what we could stop working on or choose to buy instead of build.

## Strong Opinions and Low Ego
Leaders have a strong point of view and advocate for that point of view regularly. They push themselves and their teams to do the best work possible by challenging assumptions and convention. Leaders are vocal when they disagree and can back up their opinions with sound logic. At the same time, they strive to discover and support the best idea. They are open to their own ideas evolving and recognize that, once a decision has been made, everyone must commit fully to keep the team moving forward. Finally, leaders at BuzzFeed are generous in giving credit to others, rather than simply accept credit themselves.

## Communicates Effectively
We recognize the value and power of stellar verbal and written communication. As a result, we are consistently proactive, transparent and direct in our communication, both with our teams and the rest of the organization.

## Exudes Empathy
Whether working on products or dealing with personal interactions, leaders always put themselves in others’ shoes. When there is disagreement about a particular direction or decision, they make sure to step back and consider the other party’s point of view before advocating their own. And this isn’t just lip service. Leaders consistently take the time to think through and understand all sides before approaching difficult conversations. They seek to understand experiences and perspectives that differ from their own in order to make working at BuzzFeed a great experience for everyone involved.

## Balances Short-Term Goals With Long-Term Vision
Leaders steep themselves in understanding the holistic vision for the product. At BuzzFeed, we think about the long-term impact of decisions down the road. As a result, leaders break down their long-term vision into sharply-scoped, impactful, short-term milestones and goals. They approach every project with a hypothesis to test, and let their long-term vision evolve as a result of their experimentation.

## Thinks Beyond the Product
Great leaders don’t just limit themselves to improving their product. Instead, they are always looking for ways to improve the organization around them: whether it’s iterating on their team’s process, leading retrospectives to find potential future adjustments or helping out colleagues from other departments.

## Always Follows Through
Leaders do what they say they will. When they commit, they commit fully and deliver on time. If they can’t do something themselves, they communicate to the right people and make sure the work gets done.
