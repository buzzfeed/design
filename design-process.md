# BuzzFeed’s Design Process

With this project our goal was not to enforce a new way of working, but to observe and codify what’s currently effective and create just enough structure to aid communication, clarity and transparency throughout the lifecycle of a project, both inside and outside of the design team.

A strong design process establishes a shared vocabulary and sets clear expectations to course correct early and often — not waiting until there are polished visuals before questioning something more fundamental to the product.

## The Phases of Product Design

Phases provide the macro-view of a design project with a focus on navigating time and clarifying expectations. Whatever stage they’re at designers should have a strong sense of what the remaining phases look like and be able to reflect on what phases they’ve been through so far, both for themselves but also to communicate with others on a project. Adapting quickly is important to how our organization functions so dealing with uncertainty is a reality we need to face. Due to this we chose an approach that highlights known knowns and known unknowns rather than forcing a designer through a specific sequence, or series of gates, ala the waterfall method.

There are five phases in the BuzzFeed Product Design Process, which break down as follows:

1. **Define** — Know the problem and uncover as many constraints as possible
2. **Explore** — Generate as many solutions as possible while exploring the problem space
3. **Refine** — Validate which solutions work before distilling down the simplest design
4. **Build** — Translate this design into reality through code or specs
5. **Learn** — Understand whether the design was successful and what needs further work

They unfold over time:

A project doesn’t necessarily have to conform to a particular sequence but the goal of reaching Learn as quickly as possible provides a north-star and the flexibility to adapt as the realities of a project unfold after kick off. The scale on the x-axis is variable to fit any sized project, this works as well for a project lasting a week as it does for a 6-month marathon.

And here is a project showing a slightly more realistic sequence complete with the loops that each phase is made up of:

## The Product Design Feedback Loop

The loop provides the micro-view, it’s the atomic unit of our design process. While it also happens over time, time is much less relevant here, the focus is toward deconstructing something designers typically internalize as one fluid movement in order to pinpoint areas for clarity and growth. Think of a tennis coach deconstructing a serve, this is our toolkit for analyzing each component part and helping designers grow their capability across them.

1. **Gather** input through observation, listening or research
2. **Synthesize** this input, identifying where you need to go next and what artifact will help get you there
3. **Make** an artifact, using an appropriate tool and level of fidelity
4. **Communicate** the artifact you’ve made, through the right channel, to the appropriate audience, to gather further input

Digital product design is such a new discipline that most practitioners have learned through experience, but everyone has taken a different path and some work environments simply don’t require as much explicit communication or synthesis e.g. a solo designer without a team or manager. It’s not uncommon for inexperienced designers to jump to solutions before they’ve fully unpacked and understood a problem, or to fold in all feedback they’ve received because “my peers are smart” without practicing the skill of filtering out input that’s distracting or not inline with the goals of a project. This model provides a shared language allowing others to offer precise feedback, helping a designer grow capabilities throughout the loop.

Here’s an example of three loops that could happen during an explore phase.

As you can see, this is less of a hard science and more of a tool to reveal blind spots. While this GIF explicitly mentions tools like Sketch, the framework is intended to be tool agnostic.

Process is often unique to the organization it functions inside. While our approach might be less relevant to your team, I hope you found something valuable here. At worst, it doesn’t prove useful, at best it provides a whole new way to collaborate and ultimately raise the bar for product design in your team.

We rolled this out to the designers in May 2016 and the wider BuzzFeed tech team shortly after. Further details on the rollout and what we learned can be found in [this Medium post](https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/introducing-buzzfeeds-design-process-4fefbdcd83ea) or a [talk given at Design Driven NYC in September 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcRAyi0RZsk).
