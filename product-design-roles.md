### Brand
Adheres to the holistic design vision of BuzzFeed, across products and platforms.

### Patterns
Follows existing visual and UX patterns, whether specific to BuzzFeed and/or platform, to ensure a consistent and intuitive experience across all of BuzzFeed’s features and products.

### UX Design
Familiarity with information architecture, multi-step and cross-platform flows.

Puts themselves in the shoes of the end-user and advocates that point of view to their Squad and the Product Design team.

### Process
Adopts our transparent, defined design process, which includes understanding project definition and scope, artifact creation, solicitation of feedback, iteration, prototyping, quality assurance, shipping and learning.

### Toolkit

### Transparency
Shares work early and often and seeks out constructive feedback from their manager, stakeholders, squads and the Product Design team — in Basecamp (at least once per week for active projects), presentations and Crits — and actively works with their manager to filter and prioritize this feedback.

### Experiments
Considers the project’s key metrics when working through design problems.

### Fluency
Communicates with product leads and engineers in their language, designing with consideration for their cares and concerns. Proactively works with their manager to negotiate thoughtful design outcomes when there are cross-discipline concerns.

### Writing
Actively improving their ability to communicate ideas clearly and succinctly in Basecamp, in documentation and over email, by soliciting feedback from their manager, other designers and their Squad. Writes direct, consistent and action-oriented UI copy.

### Design Leadership
Assumes a design leadership role within their product Groups. Brings a strong opinion and thoughtful voice to Group Critiques and Basecamp, at times identifying overlaps between their Groups’ work and other projects at BuzzFeed. Encourages and identifies opportunities for consistency within their own Groups, while also guiding divergent thinking so that BuzzFeed’s design systems can evolve in a healthy, transparent and holistic way.

### Group Leadership
Works closely with their Group leads to establish OKRs and a high-level strategy for their Groups. References that strategy and OKRs as a regular part of their team’s design process, bringing it up in Basecamp, Product Design Critique and other review moments to drive the design conversation in a meaningful direction. Additionally, takes responsibility for balancing speed, quality and consistency of design, ensuring that design is not blocking the team, yet also providing focused time for good design to occur.

### Mentorship
Takes on a mentorship role for the designers they manage. Provides strong guidance, goal-setting and accountability with regard to each designer’s career at BuzzFeed, design strategy, project strategy and how to approach interpersonal situations in a kind, yet impactful way. Surfaces their team members’ goals to Product Design management and Group leads and looks for ways others can help each designer make progress in their growth areas.
