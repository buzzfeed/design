# Remote Whiteboarding Tips

During the whiteboard interview, you'll be given a simple prompt and asked to work through this exercise with the help of a Senior Product Designer, Staff Product Designer, or Product Design Manager. 
We'll be evaluating the following:
* How you think through problems
* How you communicate your thought process
* Your understanding of UX best practices

**Tools:**
* Whatever you're most comfortable with!
* Some suggestions: Figma, Sketch, Whimsical, Miro

**Some tips:**
* Because this session will be remote, the approach you use might be different than what you've use in past IRL whiteboard experiences.
* The "whiteboard" is just a tool to facilitate the conversation around the prompt. These tools should be used to convey ideas visually, but at the end of the day, this is a conversation. It's even more important in this remote context to verbalize your ideas than to document them visually.
* Whatever ends up on the "whiteboard" can be really rough. We are not expecting refined wireframes or user flows!
