Here’s what we look for in the 1 hour portfolio review:
Please show **2-3 case studies** of your past work. This can include the same set of projects you walked us through in the previous meeting. Plan on a **~15–20 conversation for each**, where we may stop to ask questions throughout. The last 10 minutes will be time for any questions you have for us.


As you present, we’ll be assessing your skills across core areas of the role:
* Product thinking
* Visual design
* UX
* Communication

Tips for presenting:
We want to understand a project from end to end and to see your product thinking, UX and visual design process at work. However, we recommend spending less time on low fidelity process work (e.g. research, post its, wireframes) and focusing more time on high fidelity iterations.  


When talking through your work, we want to understand how you made design decisions and arrived at your final solution. Be prepared to talk through and share:
* Alternative solutions you considered or explored and why you decided against them (technical constraints, feedback from testing, use of data etc)
* Areas that generated friction or disagreement with collaborators
* Reflections and learnings on the final outcome you delivered

We look forward to seeing your work!
