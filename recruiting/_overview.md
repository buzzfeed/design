# BuzzFeed Design Recruiting

Hello!

Welcome to the recruiting home for BuzzFeed's Product Design team! Whether you're a candidate, a BuzzFeed employee or just someone looking to learn more about our recruiting process, the following documentation is meant to represent our best thinking at the moment, as well as give our candidates a concrete idea of what to expect when going through our recruiting process.

## Are We Hiring?

We are currently hiring!

### Sr. Product Designer, News
Work on the future of BuzzFeed News as a Product Designer alongside our awesome product and engineering team, as well as our award-winning journalism team! Email [Kelsey Scherer](mailto:kelsey.scherer@buzzfeed.com) if you're interested and feel your skills align with those in our [Product Design Roles](https://github.com/buzzfeed/design/blob/master/product-design-roles.md).

## The Team
The Product Design team at BuzzFeed is made up of multidisciplinary designers, who are individually responsible for all aspects of design: user research, UX design, visual design, prototyping and, on the web, front-end implementation. Additionally, our designers are key collaborators when it comes to cross-disciplinary activities such as product discovery and A/B experiment definition, design and analysis.

## What We Value
As these responsibilities belie, we look for team members who are curious and consider the entire product lifecycle as their responsibility. It is not uncommon for our Product Designers to write up product proposals, run trainings on how to use our internal tools, or influence the direction of our front-end architecture. We place a high value on transparency, collaboration and strong communication, sharing our work widely and inviting critique from any and all disciplines.

## On Diversity
On the BuzzFeed Product Design team, we care deeply about building a diverse team, and then supporting every team member in their career and skill growth. We are dedicated to creating and maintaining a respectful workplace that values everyone on our team bringing their whole selves to work.

BuzzFeed does not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class. If you have a disability, we're more than happy to accommodate and make the interview process better for you.

## A Note On Compensation
Unlike many other teams, BuzzFeed's Product Design team does not negotiate compensation with candidates. We will also never ask for compensation history or expectations. Instead, we use the information we've gathered about your skills to evaluate you against our [Product Design Roles](https://github.com/buzzfeed/design/blob/master/product-design-roles.md), and then place you within our salary bands according to how we've calibrated your skill set. We do this for a couple reasons:

### Equitable Compensation
Too often, the people who are paid the most are the people who negotiated during the offer process. This leaves people who are less comfortable negotiating in a weaker position when it comes to their compensation. To resolve this, we've decided to simply **give the best offer possible to every candidate** based on our salary bands and what we've concluded from the interview process. Where many companies have a predetermined ceiling during offer negotiations, we go straight to our ceiling in our offers.

### Starting Off On The Right Foot
At the end of an interview process, we want candidates to feel as excited as we are to take the next step together. We've found that when offers are negotiable, the conversations with candidates are much more fraught. By assuring candidates that our salaries are competitive with most of the Tech market and then providing them with the best offer from the start, we've found the offer process to not only be more successful, but also to cause less stress for the people we want to hire.

## The Interview Process
What follows is, generally, the process we use for every candidate we talk to. We place a high premium on creating a humane, thoughtful experience for every candidate we interview. On rare occasions, we may shuffle steps, but if we do so, we will communicate any changes and the reasoning behind them. Also, while this document provides an overview, if you're a candidate you should feel free to ask us any questions you have! Our interviews are not a test, and we want candidates to have as much information as they need to be successful. With all that said, our interviews are geared primarily toward answering two questions:

1. What could this candidate add to BuzzFeed? What skills or experiences do they have that would strengthen our team and products?
2. In what ways would we need to support this candidate to help them grow? Are we currently equipped to provide that support for the role we're hiring for?

### Teamwork and Collaboration
We'll spend a few minutes telling you about BuzzFeed, our Design team and how our different product teams are structured and work together. After that, we'll ask you a few questions about how you've worked with other designers, disciplines and stakeholders in the past. We'll dig into specific examples of disagreements you've had with others, situations you would've handled differently if you could, and times you've felt super successful in your collaborations. We'll ask you some questions about how you see your role as a Product Designer, where the lines are between you and other disciplines and what you do when those roles are unclear.

For a sample of some questions we might ask you, check out our [Interview Question Bank](https://github.com/buzzfeed/design/blob/master/recruiting/interview-questions.md).

### Portfolio Review
This interview, like it says on the box, is a deep dive into your design work with one of our managers or Sr. Product Designers. While we're certainly curious about the final result, we're even more interested in your process to get there: goals you set, iterations you tried, experiments that failed, etc. We know how messy our own projects can get, so don't be afraid to pop open a Sketch file of all your crazy ideas and show us wide exploration before describing how you narrowed in! We'll talk to you about how you validated your ideas, and what you learned after launching your project.

### Design Exercise (Optional)
In cases where we feel we need information we weren't able to glean from the previous steps, we may ask you to complete a design exercise. We pay you for your time ($500 for 10 hours of work) and give you a prompt related to an existing BuzzFeed product. We also send you a list of questions we're hoping to answer through the exercise, for example:

- Can you easily pick up and thoughtfully extend existing visual style?
- How do you account for (andÂ reduce the likelihood) of errors or incomplete form submissions?

As always, we welcome questions about the exercise (it's not a test, just a way to see skills we didn't see in the interviews up to that point) and want to provide candidates with what they need to be successful. We are also happy to work with candidates who don't feel they can spare the ten hours for the exercise to find other methods for getting what we need to move the process forward.

### Onsite Interview Loop
We'll bring you to the BuzzFeed office in New York to meet in-person with a few of our team members. Generally, our loops wind up being composed of a handful of 45-minute meetings, that are arranged something like this:

#### Portfolio Review
This is always the first session during our onsite interviews, and will include everyone you'll meet throughout the day (so, 5-6 people or so). Similar to the portfolio interview earlier in the process, we ask you to walk through 1-3 projects, talk through goals, problems along the way, iterations and learnings. Even though it's impossible to completely avoid interviews and portfolio presentations feeling stressful, we try our best to keep them feeling casual, asking questions and talking with you the way we would in any other design or product meeting.

#### Product Interview
Meet with one of our Product Managers and talk about your past relationships with PMs: what made your successful collaborations successful? What problems have you encountered? What's a time you've strongly disagreed with your PM and what happened?

#### Engineering Interview
Like the Product Interview, but about engineering. What have been your best engineering collaborations to date and why did they work out? How do you translate design into code? Have you worked with engineers across offices before? How'd that go?

#### Whiteboard Session
While many whiteboard sessions are you standing at a whiteboard alone while someone watches you try to solve a problem, that's not how we actually work at BuzzFeed. With one of our Senior Product Designers, you'll work through a product problem, establishing goals, choosing a particular part of the prompt to focus on and exploring the possibilities together. While we expect you to mostly lead the discussion, we are there to participate and help out if you get stuck (just like in real life!).

#### HTML/CSS Interview
Before the interview loop, we'll ask you how comfortable you are with HTML and CSS. With your answer in mind, we tailor this session to your skill level (and your actual skill level is not a deciding factor in our hiring process). For beginners, one of our Front-End Engineers will sit with you and teach you the basics of HTML and CSS while working through a layout problem together. If you're more experienced, we'll let you code through the same layout problem, asking you questions along the way.

### Final Decision and Offer
After the Onsite Interview, we'll gather the folks you talked with and ask them for answers to the two questions posed earlier in this document:

1. What could this candidate add to BuzzFeed? What skills or experiences do they have that would strengthen our team and products?
2. In what ways would we need to support this candidate to help them grow? Are we currently equipped to provide that support for the role we're hiring for?

We'll compare the answers we get from our interviewers with what the particular role on our team requires. If we feel there's a strong match, we'll put together an offer for you and roll it out to you. If we feel that the role we have isn't a strong match for your particular skill set, we promise to let you know just as swiftly (we know waiting for a response can be one of the worst parts of the process!).

## A Final Note
Besides making great hires, one of our overarching goals is, hopefully obviously, to give every candidate a great recruiting experience. Even when our interviews don't ultimately result in offers, we want people to feel they were treated fairly and thoughtfully. We ask regularly for feedback from our candidates, and have made many changes and adjustments to the way we interview based on critique we've received. As you go through the recruiting process with us, please don't hesitate to let us know how it's going for you, or if you see areas we could improve! Doing so will not only improve your experience with us, but the experience of other designers in the future!
