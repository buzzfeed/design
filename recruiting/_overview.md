# BuzzFeed Design Recruiting

Hello!

Welcome to the recruiting home for BuzzFeed's Product Design team! Whether you're a candidate, a BuzzFeed employee or just someone looking to learn more about our recruiting process, the following documentation is meant to represent our best thinking at the moment, as well as give our candidates a concrete idea of what to expect when going through our recruiting process.

## The Team
The Product Design team at BuzzFeed is made up of multidisciplinary designers, who are individually responsible for all aspects of design: user research, UX design, visual design, prototyping and, on the web, front-end implementation. Additionally, our designers are key collaborators when it comes to cross-disciplinary activities such as product discovery and A/B experiment definition, design and analysis.

## What We Value
As these responsibilities belie, we look for team members who are curious and consider the entire product lifecycle as their responsibility. It is not uncommon for our Product Designers to write up product proposals, run trainings on how to use our internal tools, or influence the direction of our front-end architecture. We place a high value on transparency, collaboration and strong communication, sharing our work widely and inviting critique from any and all disciplines.

## On Diversity
On the BuzzFeed Product Design team, we care deeply about building a diverse team, and then supporting them in their career and skill growth. We are dedicated to creating and maintaining a respectful workplace that values everyone on our team bringing their whole selves to work.

BuzzFeed does not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class. If you have a disability, we're more than happy to accommodate and make the interview process better for you.

## A Note On Compensation
Unlike many other teams, BuzzFeed's Product Design team does not negotiate compensation with candidates. We will also never ask for compensation history or expectations. Instead, we use the information we've gathered about your skills to evaluate you against our [Product Design Roles](https://github.com/buzzfeed/design/blob/master/product-design-roles.md), and then place you within our salary bands according to how we've calibrated your skill set. We do this for a couple reasons:

### Equitable Compensation
Too often, the people who are paid the most are the people who negotiated during the offer process. This leaves people who are less comfortable negotiating in a weaker position when it comes to their compensation. To resolve this, we've decided to simply **give the best offer possible to every candidate** based on our salary bands and what we've concluded from the interview process. Where many companies have a predetermined ceiling during offer negotiations, we go straight to our ceiling in our offers.

### Starting Off On The Right Foot
At the end of an interview process, we want candidates to feel as excited as we are to take the next step together. We've found that when offers are negotiable, the conversations with candidates are much more fraught. By assuring candidates that our salaries are competitive with most of the Tech market and then providing them with the best offer from the start, we've found the offer process to not only be more successful, but also to cause less stress for the people we want to hire.
